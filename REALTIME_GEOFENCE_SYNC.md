# Real-Time Geofence Sync Implementation

## Date
October 10, 2025

## Problem
Previously, when a parent created a new geofence, the child app would **not** detect it until the app was restarted or location sharing was toggled off and on. The child app only fetched geofences once at startup.

## Solution
Implemented a **real-time Firestore listener** in `LocationService` that automatically syncs geofence changes from the database to the child app.

## Changes Made

### 1. LocationService.swift

#### Added Properties
```swift
private var geofenceListener: ListenerRegistration? // Real-time listener for geofence changes
```

#### New Method: `setupGeofenceListener()`
- **Purpose**: Sets up a Firestore snapshot listener for the geofences collection
- **Triggers**: Called when location sharing starts
- **Behavior**: 
  - Listens to geofences collection filtered by child's familyId
  - Automatically updates `cachedGeofences` when changes occur
  - Logs detailed information about geofence changes
  - Works in real-time - no polling needed

#### Modified Methods

**`startLocationUpdates()`**
- Now calls `setupGeofenceListener()` instead of one-time `fetchGeofences()`
- Real-time listener starts as soon as location sharing begins

**`stopLocationUpdates()`**
- Added cleanup code to remove the Firestore listener
- Prevents memory leaks and unnecessary background processing

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
Parent creates/updates/deletes geofence
    ↓
Firestore database updated
    ↓
Firestore notifies all listeners automatically
    ↓
Child app's snapshot listener triggered
    ↓
cachedGeofences array updated in LocationService
    ↓
IMMEDIATELY checks current location against new geofences
    ↓
If child is inside new geofence → logs ENTER event instantly
    ↓
Otherwise → next location update (2-5 min) will check again
```

### Timing
- **Initial Load**: Listener is set up when child starts location sharing
- **Updates**: Instant - Firestore pushes changes as they happen
- **Cleanup**: Listener removed when location sharing stops

## Console Logging

### When Listener Starts
```
📍 Setting up real-time geofence listener for family [familyId]
✅ Real-time geofence listener active
```

### When Geofences Change
```
📍 ✨ Geofences updated via real-time listener: 2 → 3
📍   - School (500m)
📍   - Home (300m)
📍   - Park (400m)
📍 Checking current location against updated geofences...
📍 Child is inside geofence: Park (distance: 150m, radius: 400m)
📍 Synthetic ENTER event: Park
```

### When Listener Stops
```
📍 Geofence listener stopped
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Sync**: Child app gets new geofences within seconds
2. **Instant Detection**: Immediately checks if child is already inside new geofence
3. **No App Restart Required**: Works while app is running in background
4. **Battery Efficient**: Uses Firestore's efficient push mechanism (no polling)
5. **Automatic**: No manual intervention needed
6. **Always Up-to-Date**: Child always has latest geofence list

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Create New Geofence (Child Inside)
1. Child app running with location sharing enabled
2. Child is physically at a location (e.g., at school)
3. Parent creates new geofence at that location (e.g., "School")
4. Check child app console logs
5. **Expected**: 
   - See "📍 ✨ Geofences updated via real-time listener: X → X+1"
   - See "📍 Checking current location against updated geofences..."
   - See "📍 Child is inside geofence: School"
   - See "📍 Synthetic ENTER event: School"
6. **Expected**: Parent receives push notification immediately

### Test Scenario 2: Create New Geofence (Child Outside)
1. Child app running with location sharing enabled
2. Parent creates new geofence at different location
3. Check child app console logs
4. **Expected**: See "📍 ✨ Geofences updated via real-time listener: X → X+1"
5. **Expected**: No immediate ENTER event (child is outside)
6. Child moves into geofence area
7. **Expected**: ENTER event on next location update (2-5 min)

### Test Scenario 3: Update Geofence
1. Child app running
2. Parent edits geofence (change name, radius, or location)
3. Check child app console logs
4. **Expected**: See "📍 Geofences refreshed via real-time listener"
5. **Expected**: Updated geofence details in logs
6. **Expected**: Immediate containment check with current location

### Test Scenario 4: Delete Geofence
1. Child app running inside a geofence
2. Parent deletes that geofence
3. **Expected**: See geofence count decrease
4. Wait for next location update
5. **Expected**: No more enter/exit events for deleted geofence

### Test Scenario 5: Listener Cleanup
1. Child app running with location sharing enabled
2. Child stops location sharing
3. **Expected**: See "📍 Geofence listener stopped" in logs
4. Parent creates new geofence
5. **Expected**: Child app does NOT receive update (listener is off)

## Performance Considerations

### Memory
- Only one listener per child app instance
- Automatically cleaned up when location sharing stops
- Uses weak self reference to prevent retain cycles

### Network
- Firestore uses WebSockets for efficient real-time updates
- Minimal bandwidth usage (only changed documents transmitted)
- Works on cellular and WiFi

### Battery
- No polling/repeated queries needed
- Firestore manages connection efficiently
- Listener only active when location sharing is enabled

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Offline Support**: Cache geofences locally for offline access
2. **Optimization**: Only update if documents actually changed (use snapshot metadata)
3. **Parent Notification**: Alert parent if child's listener disconnects
4. **Retry Logic**: Auto-reconnect listener if connection drops

### Android Compatibility
When building Android version, the same approach will work:
- Use Firebase Android SDK
- Add snapshot listener in background service
- Same Firestore collection and structure
- Zero backend changes needed

## Conclusion

The child app now receives geofence updates in real-time, eliminating the need for app restarts and ensuring parents' location alerts are always current. This matches the intended behavior described in `Native_App_Plan.md`:

> "Child's app listens for changes in Firestore and downloads the geofence definitions."
