**In RevenueCat Dashboard:**
- **Entitlements**: Shows "premium" entitlement as active
- **Active Subscriptions**: Shows subscription details
  - Product: `located_family_monthly`
  - Start date

- âœ… Full access
- âœ… Settings shows "Active | Renews [date]"

---

### 4. **Canceled (But Active Until End)**

**Setup:**

## ðŸ“Š How to View in RevenueCat Dashboard

1. **Login**: https://app.revenuecat.com

Attributes are synced to RevenueCat when:

**Note:** Attributes may take a few seconds to appear in dashboard. Refresh the customer page if needed.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Workflow

### Test Sequence:
1. **Start**: Active trial â†’ Check dashboard shows trial attributes
2. **Expire**: Set trial to past â†’ Check dashboard shows expired
3. **Purchase**: Use sandbox account â†’ Check dashboard shows active subscription
4. **Cancel**: Cancel subscription â†’ Check dashboard shows canceled but active

### What to Verify:
- [ ] User appears in RevenueCat Customers list
- [ ] Attributes show current trial status
