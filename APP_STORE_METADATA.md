### Review Notes
```
Located is a family safety app that enables real-time location sharing between family members. Key features include:

1. Real-time location tracking with geofence alerts
2. Family member invitations and management
3. Arrival/departure notifications for designated areas
4. Emergency location sharing capabilities
5. Privacy-focused design with family-only data sharing

The app requires location permissions to function properly. All location data is encrypted and shared only within designated family groups.

For testing, you can create a family group by inviting another user via email or phone number. The app works best when multiple family members are added to demonstrate the sharing features.

Location permissions are clearly explained in the app and users can disable sharing at any time through the app settings.
