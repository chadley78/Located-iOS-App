# Deep Link Testing Guide

## What I've Implemented

### 1. **Child Signup Without Email**
- Created `ChildSignUpView` that only requires:
  - Child's name
  - Invitation code
- Uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication (no email required)
- Automatically joins family upon successful signup

### 2. **Deep Linking Support**
- Added URL scheme: `located://invite/ABC123`
- Added universal link support: `https://located.app/invite/ABC123`
- Configured Info.plist with `CFBundleURLTypes`

### 3. **Enhanced Invitation Sharing**
- Parents can now share both:
  - Invitation code (text)
  - Deep link (clickable)
- Share button generates comprehensive message with both options

## How It Works

### For Parents:
1. Create invitation → Get code (e.g., "ABC123")
2. Share button generates message:
   ```
   Join my family on Located! Use this code: ABC123
   
   Or click this link: located://invite/ABC123
   
   If the link doesn't work, use this: https://located.app/invite/ABC123
   ```

### For Children:
1. **Via Deep Link**: Click link → App opens → Code pre-filled → Enter name → Join family
2. **Via Code**: Open app → Select "I'm a Child" → Enter name + code → Join family

## Testing Deep Links

### Simulator Testing:
```bash
# Test deep link in iOS Simulator
xcrun simctl openurl booted "located://invite/ABC123"
```

### Device Testing:
1. Send invitation via WhatsApp/SMS
2. Child clicks link
3. App should open with code pre-filled

## URL Formats Supported:
- `located://invite/ABC123` (deep link)
- `https://located.app/invite/ABC123` (universal link)

## Next Steps:
1. Test the implementation
2. Set up universal link domain (located.app)
3. Add analytics to track invitation success rates
