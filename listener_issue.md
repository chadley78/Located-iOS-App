The refresh button issue is still there. Let me investigate further. The problem might be deeper than just timing - let me check what's actually happening in the family listener.

Let me look at the family listener logic more carefully:

I think I see a potential issue. The family listener is set up correctly, but there might be a problem with the timing of when it's started. Let me check if the issue is that the family listener is being started before the user document is properly saved.

Let me add some debugging to see what's actually happening. The issue might be that the `forceRefreshFamilyListener()` is being called before the user document has been updated by the Cloud Function.

Let me modify the approach to be more robust:

Now let me also increase the delay in the child signup flow to give the Cloud Function more time:

Let me check for any linting errors:

## Updated Fix for Refresh Button Issue

I've made the refresh mechanism more robust:

### **Enhanced `forceRefreshFamilyListener()` Method:**
- ✅ **Retry logic**: Tries up to 3 times with 1-second delays between attempts
- ✅ **Better debugging**: Shows each attempt and what it finds
- ✅ **Graceful fallback**: If no `familyId` found after 3 attempts, still restarts the listener

### **Increased Delay:**
- ✅ **2-second delay**: Gives the Cloud Function more time to update the user document
- ✅ **Better timing**: Reduces the chance of checking before the update is complete

### **How It Works Now:**

1. **Child accepts invitation** → Cloud Function updates child's `familyId`
2. **2-second delay** → Ensures Cloud Function completes
3. **Retry mechanism** → `forceRefreshFamilyListener()` tries up to 3 times
4. **Each attempt** → Checks user document for `familyId` with 1-second delays
5. **Success** → Starts fresh family listener when `familyId` is found
6. **Fallback** → Restarts listener anyway to clear stale state

### **Test It:**
The child invitation flow should now be much more reliable:
- ✅ **Multiple attempts** to find the updated `familyId`
- ✅ **Better timing** with longer delays
- ✅ **Robust fallback** if timing issues persist

Try the complete child invitation flow again - the retry mechanism should catch the `familyId` update even if there are timing variations!
