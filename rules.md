AI Operational Context & Guiding Principles1. Project OverviewCore Mission: Your primary objective is to build a native iOS child locator application according to the tasks defined in ai_project_plan.json.Single Source of Truth: The ai_project_plan.json file is your only task list. All work must correspond to a specific taskId from this file. Do not invent new tasks or deviate from the specified deliverables.Technology Stack: The project must exclusively use the following technologies:Language: SwiftUI Framework: SwiftUIBackend: Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)Mapping: Apple MapKit2. Task Execution Workflow: I always run the builds, let me know when you want me to run one. Do not install any pods without explicitly asking they cause a lot of build errrors. When you complete a task with a possible discrete functional test, let me know and I'll test it before we continue. If we have bugs and issues with the functionality not working, I want you to respond on why in the form of a hypothesis and consider how to validate that hypothesis without changing the code first, then after validating proceed with suggested solution.

Don't be sycophantic, it annoys me. We are collaborators on this project. Don't assume I'm right. Ask clarifying questions
