# Geofence Notifications Setup

## Overview
Push notifications for geofence events (when children enter/exit location alerts) are now fully configured and ready to use on **both iOS and Android** devices.

## Implementation Date
October 9, 2025

## How It Works

### Flow
```
1. Child enters/exits geofence
   â†“
2. LocationService logs geofence event to Firestore (geofence_events collection)
   â†“
3. Cloud Function `onGeofenceEvent` triggers automatically
   â†“
4. Function finds all parents in family
   â†“
5. Gets parent FCM tokens from user documents
   â†“
6. Sends push notification to all parent devices
   â†“
7. Parent receives notification (even if app is closed/backgrounded)
```

### Components

#### 1. Cloud Function (`onGeofenceEvent`)
**Location**: `functions/index.js` lines 23-204
**Trigger**: Firestore document created in `geofence_events/{eventId}`
**Status**: âœ… **Already deployed** (verified via `firebase functions:list`)

**What it does:**
- Extracts geofence event details (child, geofence name, enter/exit)
- Finds all parents in the child's family
- Retrieves parent FCM tokens from Firestore
- Sends push notification via Firebase Admin SDK
- Cleans up invalid/expired tokens automatically

#### 2. Parent FCM Registration
**Location**: `ContentView.swift` ParentHomeView `.onAppear` (lines 1436-1440)
**Status**: âœ… **Just added**

**What happens:**
- When parent opens app, automatically requests notification permission
- Registers device with Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Stores FCM token in parent's user document (`fcmTokens` array)
- Happens silently in background on app launch

#### 3. Child Geofence Detection
**Location**: `LocationService.swift` `checkGeofenceContainment()` (lines 481-522)
**Status**: âœ… **Already implemented**

**What triggers events:**
- Every location update (every 2-5 minutes)
- Synthetic events when containment state changes
- Works even if phone restarted, app restarted, or iOS boundary not crossed

## Notification Format

### Title
```
[Child Name] entered/left [Geofence Name]
```
Examples:
- "Emma entered School"
- "Jack left Home"

### Body
```
Location: [Address or "Unknown location"]
```
Example:
- "Location: 123 Main St Dublin D14 NY16"

### Data Payload (for app deep linking)
```json
{
  "type": "geofence_event",
  "childId": "abc123",
  "childName": "Emma",
  "geofenceId": "def456",
  "geofenceName": "School",
  "eventType": "enter",
  "timestamp": "1728492000000",
  "location": "{\"lat\":53.29,\"lng\":-6.30,...}"
}
```

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### âœ… iOS (Current)
- Uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- APNs (Apple Push Notification service) under the hood
- NotificationService handles permissions and display
- Works in foreground, background, and when app is closed

### âœ… Android (Future-Ready)
- **Same FCM infrastructure works on Android**
- No backend changes needed
- Android app just needs:
  - Firebase SDK integration
  - FCM token registration (same as iOS)
  - Notification permission handling (Android 13+)
- Cloud Function already sends to any FCM token (iOS or Android)

## Testing

### Test Flow
1. **Setup**:
   - Build parent app in Xcode
   - Open app (triggers FCM registration)
   - Check console for "ðŸ“± Parent registered for geofence notifications"
   - Check console for "âœ… FCM token registered: [token]"

2. **Trigger Event**:
   - Child device enters or exits a geofence
   - Or use simulated location to cross geofence boundary
   - Or turn child phone off outside, on inside geofence

3. **Verify**:
   - Parent device should receive push notification
   - Check Cloud Function logs: `firebase functions:log --only onGeofenceEvent`
   - Look for: "Notification sent for geofence event [id]"

### Debug Commands

**Check deployed functions:**
```bash
firebase functions:list
```

**View Cloud Function logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only onGeofenceEvent
```

**Check specific event:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only onGeofenceEvent --limit 50
```

## Notification States

### When Notification Shows

| App State | iOS Behavior | Android Behavior |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Foreground** | Banner at top (configured) | Heads-up notification |
| **Background** | Notification in tray | Notification in tray |
| **Closed** | Notification in tray | Notification in tray |

### When Tapped
- App opens (if closed)
- App comes to foreground (if backgrounded)
- Data payload available for deep linking (future enhancement)

## Token Management

### Registration
- **Parents**: Register on ParentHomeView appearance
- **Children**: Already register on app startup (for future features)

### Storage
- Stored in Firestore: `users/{userId}/fcmTokens` (array)
- Multiple tokens per user supported (multiple devices)

### Cleanup
- Invalid tokens automatically removed by Cloud Function
- Failed send attempts trigger `cleanupFailedTokens()`
- Prevents unnecessary notification attempts

## Security & Privacy

### Who Receives Notifications
- **Only parents in the same family** as the child
- Determined by `families/{familyId}/members` document
- Family membership required to receive notifications

### Data Transmitted
- Child name, geofence name, event type (enter/exit)
- Location address (not exact coordinates in notification)
- Timestamp of event
- All data already visible to parents in app

### Token Security
- FCM tokens are device-specific
- Tokens are not secret (used only for routing)
- Firebase handles authentication via Admin SDK
- No sensitive data in notification payload

## Configuration Files

### iOS Info.plist
**Already configured** - No changes needed
- Background modes: location
- Notification permissions strings

### Firebase Project
**Project**: located-d9dce
**Region**: us-central1
**Functions**: onGeofenceEvent (v2, nodejs22)

### Cloud Function Settings
```javascript
setGlobalOptions({maxInstances: 10}); // Cost control
```

## Costs

### Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Free**: Up to 10,000,000 notifications/month
- Our usage: ~100-1000/month (very low)

### Cloud Functions
- **Free tier**: 2,000,000 invocations/month
- Our usage: One invocation per geofence event
- Cost: Effectively $0

## Troubleshooting

### Notification Not Received

1. **Check parent FCM token registered:**
   ```
   Console: "ðŸ“± Parent registered for geofence notifications"
   Console: "âœ… FCM token registered: [long token]"
   ```

2. **Check geofence event logged:**
   ```
   Firestore â†’ geofence_events collection â†’ recent document
   ```

3. **Check Cloud Function triggered:**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --only onGeofenceEvent
   ```
   Look for: "Processing geofence event: [id]"

4. **Check notification sent:**
   ```
   Cloud Function logs: "Notification sent for geofence event [id]"
   Check successCount > 0
   ```

5. **Check iOS notification permissions:**
   ```
   Settings â†’ Located App â†’ Notifications â†’ Allow Notifications (ON)
   ```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No FCM tokens found for parents"
**Solution**: Ensure parent app has been opened and FCM registration completed

**Issue**: "Failed to send to token"
**Solution**: Token may be invalid/expired - will be auto-cleaned up

**Issue**: Notification shows but no sound
**Solution**: Check device Do Not Disturb settings and app notification settings

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Deep Linking**: Tap notification â†’ open child on map
2. **Custom Sounds**: Different sounds for enter vs exit
3. **Notification Grouping**: Group multiple events from same child
4. **Quiet Hours**: Disable notifications during certain times
5. **Notification History**: In-app history of past notifications
6. **Rich Notifications**: Show child photo, map preview
7. **Action Buttons**: "View on Map", "Dismiss" buttons

### Android App
When building Android version:
1. Add Firebase SDK to Android project
2. Copy `google-services.json` to app directory
3. Request notification permissions (Android 13+)
4. Register FCM token (same `registerFCMToken` flow)
5. **That's it!** Cloud Function already compatible
